# Spending Calculator App üíµ

**<p>In this project, I created an income expense calculator with HTML Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. You can use '+' signs for income and '-' signs for expenses. How much your monthly earnings are calculated based on the expenses entered in the income statement. Let's look at the features of the project:</p>**

<strong>
<ul>
<li>Creating income and expense elements according to the selected operator</li>
<li>Deleting the desired expense or income from the list or the entire list</li>
<li>View expenses, earnings and total profit and loss in the list</li>
<li>Expenditure and earnings data are kept in localstorage, so you can continue calculating where you left off even when you exit the browser and enter it again.</li>

  
</ul>
